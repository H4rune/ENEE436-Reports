Hello!

There are two files present in the code folder
- SVM_implementation
- CNN Modifications

Both are .ipynb files that are meant to be opened with jupyter notebooks

Each file is meant to be run by first running the first cell(which initializes all the variable)
and then by running whichever cell you desire below it. There are clearly marked cells which I used
to generate my csv dataset through the implementation of either SVM classifier or CNN.

There is another folder called data which includes my csv data that I obtained through
running these scripts
